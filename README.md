## Synopsis

  A finite state machine is a very good way to simplify a project when sequential logic is required. It helps your code to stay clean and easy to understand.

  It is an abstract machine that can be in one of a finite number of states. The machine is in only one state at a time; the state it is in at any given time is called the current state. It can change from one state to another when initiated by a triggering event or condition; this is called a transition. A particular FSM is defined by a list of its states, its initial state, and the triggering condition for each transition.

## Code Example

 [See a basic example on the dedicated website](http://bumpjs.lcluber.com/#source).

## Motivation

The main purpose of this library is to provide a simple way to handle sequential logics.
